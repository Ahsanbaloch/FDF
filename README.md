# FDF - Fil de Fer (Wireframe Model)

## Project Overview

FDF (Fil de Fer) is a 42 school project that introduces students to the fascinating world of computer graphics programming. This project challenges participants to create a simple 3D wireframe renderer, laying the foundation for more complex graphics projects in the future.

## Key Features

- **Map Parsing**: Read and interpret 3D map files
- **Wireframe Rendering**: Display 3D models as wireframes
- **3D Transformations**: Implement rotation, scaling, and translation
- **Projection**: Apply isometric or parallel projection techniques
- **Color Gradients**: Add depth perception through color manipulation
- **User Interaction**: Handle keyboard/mouse inputs for model manipulation

## Technical Aspects

- **Language**: C
- **Graphics Library**: MinilibX
- **Key Concepts**:
  - Matrix operations
  - Bresenham's line algorithm
  - Perspective and parallel projections
  - Event handling in graphical interfaces

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the basics of creating graphical applications
- Improve skills in C programming and algorithm implementation
- Learn about 3D space representation in a 2D environment
- Gain experience with mathematical concepts in computer graphics

## Challenges

- Efficient parsing and storage of map data
- Implementing smooth and accurate wireframe rendering
- Optimizing performance for larger and more complex models
- Handling various edge cases and map formats

## Usage

```bash
./fdf [map_file]
